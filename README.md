# Sleep Theory – III

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I've seen things
that I never wanted to see
Pull me down
and I can't come back
And it seems like
they're always coming in III's
They close in and I can't react
I can't believe
That you're a part of everything
when it breaks in III
And you're laughing back at me
In times of pain
And tragedy
It comes in waves,
it comes in III's
When everything
Comes down on me
It comes in waves,
it comes in III's
(It comes in waves,
it comes in III's)
You burn everything
that you touch to the ground
You leave behind a trail of lies
You lost
Any chance to bring this back
to life
I can't believe
That you're a part of everything
when it breaks in III
And you're laughing back at me
In times of pain
And tragedy
It comes in waves,
it comes in III's
When everything
Comes down on me
It comes in waves,
it comes in III's
Well, looks who's laughing now
In times of pain
And tragedy
You're behind it all
You're the worst of III
So go and say it with a smile
It's just another crooked lie
In times of pain
And tragedy
It comes in waves,
it comes in III's
When everything
Comes down on me
It comes in waves,
it comes in III's
Oh
It comes in III's
It comes in III's
It comes in III's
It comes in III's
It comes in III's
